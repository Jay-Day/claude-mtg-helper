## Common Color Identity Mistakes

### ❌ **NEVER DO THESE:**
- Add Green cards to a Dimir (UB) deck
- Add Black cards to a Selesnya (GW) deck  
- Add White cards to a Grixis (UBR) deck
- Add Blue cards to a Naya (RGW) deck
- Add Red cards to an Abzan (WBG) deck

### ✅ **ALWAYS REMEMBER:**
- Hybrid mana symbols count as BOTH colors (e.g., {W/U} requires White OR Blue identity)
- Reminder text counts for color identity (e.g., Extort reminder text makes cards White/Black)
- Lands with mana symbols in rules text require that color identity
- Colorless cards fit in ANY deck regardless of commander colors
- Basic lands can only be included if they match commander's color identity

## Deck Building Process for Commander

### **Step 1: Identify Commander's Color Identity**
Look at ALL mana symbols anywhere on the card:
- Casting cost
- Rules text  
- Reminder text
- Activated abilities

### **Step 2: Determine Available Card Pool**
Only cards with mana symbols matching or contained within the commander's color identity can be included.

### **Step 3: Build 99-Card Deck**
- Exactly 99 cards plus 1 commander (100 total)
- No duplicates except basic lands
- All cards must match color identity
- Include appropriate mana base for colors

### **Step 4: Verify Color Identity Compliance**
Double-check every card for mana symbols that might violate color identity restrictions.
