- âœ… Uses the efficient `scripts/search_cards.py` script
- âœ… Displays results in ASCII MTG card format
- âœ… Supports partial name matching and set filtering

### Rulings Lookup
Ask for rulings on specific cards or interactions: "what are the rulings for Kaalia of the Vast?"

### Format Information  
Ask about format specifications: "what are the deck construction rules for Modern?"

### Card Legality
Ask about card legality: "is Lightning Bolt legal in Standard?"

### Set Data Management
Ask Claude to fetch new sets: "fetch the Bloomburrow set" or "add Dominaria United to the database"
- âœ… Uses `scripts/fetch_set_cards.py` to get data from Scryfall API

### Ban List Updates
Ask for help updating banned/restricted lists when new announcements are made

## Scripts Available
### `scripts/fetch_set_cards.py`
Fetches all cards from a specific MTG set via Scryfall API and saves to card-library/<set-name>/

**Usage:**
- `python scripts/fetch_set_cards.py <set_code>` (e.g., "blb", "dmu")  
- `python scripts/fetch_set_cards.py "<set_name>"` (e.g., "Dominaria United")

**Output:**
- `card-library/<set-name>/all_cards_<code>.json` - Complete card data
- `card-library/<set-name>/set_info_<code>.json` - Set metadata

**Note:** Always verify set codes/names exist in Scryfall before fetching

3. **For Standard legality**: âœ… Check current Standard sets list and `card-library/` contents
4. **For banned/restricted lists**: âœ… Reference `formats/banned-restricted.md`
5. **For rules questions**: âœ… Reference `rules/comprehensive-rules-summary.md` and `rulings/common-interactions.md` (planned)

## Commander Deck Building Guidelines

**CRITICAL: When recommending cards for Commander decks, ALWAYS respect color identity restrictions:**

- Only cards matching the commander's color identity can be included in the deck
- Color identity includes mana symbols in casting cost, rules text, and reminder text
- Colorless cards can be included in any Commander deck

**For complete color identity reference, see:** `formats/commander-color-identity.md`

**Quick Examples:**
- **Dimir Commander (UB)**: Only Blue, Black, and colorless cards
- **Naya Commander (RGW)**: Only Red, Green, White, and colorless cards  
- **Four-Color Commander (WUBG)**: Only White, Blue, Black, Green, and colorless cards
- **Five-Color Commander (WUBRG)**: All colors and colorless cards allowed

**When building Commander decks:**
1. First identify the commander's color identity using `formats/commander-color-identity.md`
2. Only search for and recommend cards within those colors
3. Focus on colorless utility when color restrictions are tight
4. Never recommend cards outside the commander's color identity

Remember: This repository aims to eliminate the need for web searches on common MTG questions by providing comprehensive, current, and well-organized reference materials.
